    "What follows are a number of tasks in which you will receive or create a dataset to play around with. The main points the allow you to get 'a feel' for the dataset, with functions you create yourself. This is an important and often overlooked part of data science. It allows for sanity checks, which should be done and redone throughout any data science project. A lot of mistakes can be avoided this way, by simple checking of every outcome 'makes sense' (e.g. realising a maximum age in a dataset is 684 years or predicting that a probability is negative). Not all  commands needed have been explained literally previously, so mess around with the build-in Pythin information.\n",
